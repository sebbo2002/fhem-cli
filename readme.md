## Installation

`fhem-cli` is written in JavaScript. If you have already installed node.js, you can use `npm` to install `fhem-cli` as well.
```bash
# Install it via npm
npm i -g @sebbo2002/fhem-cli

If you don't want to install `node`, you can also have a look on [the releases page](https://github.com/sebbo2002/fhem-cli/releases), where some precompiled binaries are ready to be used.
